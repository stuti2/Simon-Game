# Simon-Game

Simon game is a simple game that is modelled off the game Simon. So the way that it works is that press any key to start and it will show a tile, click on it. And as level increases, the patterns get more and more complicated, and if a wrong tile is clicked, then the game is over, so press any key to restart the game.
